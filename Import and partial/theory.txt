SASS Import and partial
CSS provides @import option that makes you able to split your CSS into smaller, more maintainable portions. 
The only one limitation is that each time you use @import in CSS, it creates another HTTP request.

Sass builds on top of the current CSS @import. It doesn't need to require an HTTP request. Instead of this, 
it simply takes the file that you want to import and combine it with the file you're importing into so you 
can serve a single CSS file to the web browser.

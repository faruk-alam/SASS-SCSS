Sass Mixins
Sass Mixins facilitates you to make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse repeatedly on your site. 
You can even pass the value according to your need to make the mixin more flexible.

The mixin can store multiple values or parameters and call function to avoid writing repetitive codes. 
Mixin names can use underscores and hyphens interchangeably.

mixin is taken and optional arguments are passed into it.
